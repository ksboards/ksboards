### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github profile where i add sometimes some projects i did in the past or develop right now

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ¤©ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on magnetic pulse generator and at the same time learning pcb circuit design using altium designer and kicad
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that develop iot devices or iot prototyping
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with signal integrity in multilayer boards and simulations
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my old projects, what's my goal ...
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: send me a message on LinkedIn.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: none haha !!

Feel free to contact me,  ask, or just say what you think about new techs ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…
